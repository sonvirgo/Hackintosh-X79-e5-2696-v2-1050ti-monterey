macOS 12 Gtx1050ti Xcode runs fine :D Full QE/CI

Metal is not an issue if your dont need Metal. Many macOS ecosystem softwares still run on OpenGL. Even Xcode itself runs on OpenGL.
Unless you develop some software in Xcode that use Metal API,.and you want to test the app in Metal Framework . If you just develop iOS app on Xcode, it should be fine without Metal. 

Stupid idiots just barks and barks :D

How do you think when people run Xcode on VMware

Just some stupid jealous to critics :D

Any one show me his Xcode project using Metal Framework , or just some stupid bookworms :D What the heck thier business to do with Metal, CUDA, NVenc kkkk :D

Many stupid guys said Nvidia Web driver died blo bla.....

The problem is to Hackintosh or to NOT Hackintosh :D

What to demonstrate here. Reading proficiency , or handon experience ?

Scam ba la bo lo.....
:D :D

Stupid is stupid
